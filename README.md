Python codes for implementing various Machine Learning models to promote prognosis in People Living with HTLV

So far this repository has two files:
-The first, entitled: ML_INT_SIMP_HTLV_2023.ipynb
Which was the basis for a curriculum that won an honorable mention at the 'XVI INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON HTLV IN BRAZIL"

- And the second entitled: ML_MEST_HTLV+MBL2+CLINICAL.ipynb
Which is the basis for my master's thesis, which aims to make a prognosis in relation to progression to HAM/TSP in patients living with HTLV, treated at a reference center in Pernambuco, Brazil.
